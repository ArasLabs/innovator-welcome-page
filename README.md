# Innovator Welcome Page

This community project adds a new form to greet the user when first logging into Innovator. It uses a method called aras.MetadataCache.GetConfigurableUiAsync to grab the cached TOC, and then restructures it into the Homepage. Administrators can set the welcome_page form as a "Start Page" for individual Users/Identities. 

The startpage allows users to quickly launch searches for any ItemType they have access to. It also allows them to easily create a new Item, as long as they have the correct permissions to do so. 

The welcome page is also included in the TOC. The TOC Access of the welcome_page ItemType is set to world, because TOC Access is necessary for a designated Start Page. This also allows users to get back to the welcome screen at any point.
